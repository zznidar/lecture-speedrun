# lecture-speedrun
Lecture Speedrun. Prototype. Very experimental. Accessible [here:](https://zznidar.github.io/lecture-speedrun/) [https://zznidar.github.io/lecture-speedrun/](https://zznidar.github.io/lecture-speedrun/)

Inspired by [carykh](https://github.com/carykh)'s [Automatic on-the-fly video editing tool!](https://youtu.be/DQ8orIurGxw) and [jumpcutter](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter).

## Very experimental
Prototype tested only in Chrome. Firefox may not play any audio. 

## Troubleshooting
* Make sure not to use the _lefting_ functionality. It really does more harm than good.
* Some users report better performance if they disable _Hardware-accelerated video decode_ and _Hardware-accelerated video encode_ under chrome://flags
